  "title": "Add issues-fs validate command to detect invalid issue data",
  "description": "Add a 'validate' command to the issues-fs CLI that scans all issue JSON files and reports schema violations (e.g. invalid Obj_Id values in node_id or created_by fields) without crashing. Currently, a single invalid field causes the entire 'list' command to fail with a ValueError. The validate command should: (1) scan all issue.json files recursively, (2) attempt to deserialize each against Schema__Node, (3) collect and report all validation errors with file paths and field names, (4) exit with non-zero status if any errors found. This would have caught the invalid Obj_Id values (e.g. 'system', 'conductor-agent') that broke CLI listing on two repos.",
